# DSUtils
A comprehensive collection of utilities designed to supercharge my (and hopefully others) data science workflow.

## Design

The utilities are designed to be used within a Anaconda environment using Jupyter notebooks.
They are also designed with a particular workflow in mind. The workflow is as follows:
- As a data scientist, you perform experiments on data.
- Some experiments are successful, and you want to save the results.
- You want to be able to easily access the results of succesfull experiments.
